### Data Provenance

## NGO data sources

WHO data available for download from: http://www.who.int/gho/en/
- Note: the dataset we use was collected from an old statistics course I took and is both outdated and the fields were likely self-selected (or the default fields for a previous interfce on the WHO website). 

GDP data available for download from: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table

IMF data available for download from: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/index.aspx
- Note: this dataset was collected more than 2 years ago via an interface that is no longer available. The data can be selected and assembled to match, but likely much transformation would be required. To note, this means the forecasts in the data beyond 2015 are inaccurate as well.
